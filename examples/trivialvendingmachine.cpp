/**
 * @file trivialvendingmachine.cpp
 * @brief Vending Machine with Named TopicStates and GraphAnalyzer
 *
 * @section Introduction
 * This example gives a single-detector solution for a hypothetical one-item,
 * one-coin vending machine. It shows how a single detector can be used to
 * synchronize combine signals - coins being inserted and the "Buy" button being
 * clicked - to produce a third - SaleCompleted. It also introduces the concepts
 * of _Trivial TopicStates_,  _Named TopicStates_ and using GraphAnalyzer.
 *
 * @section tts Trivial TopicStates
 * A _Trivial TopicState_ has no data fields:
 @snippetlineno trivialvendingmachine.cpp Trivial TopicState
 * These are sometimes useful to represent parameter-less signals, timeouts etc.
 *
 * @section nts Named TopicStates
 * _Named TopicStates_, as opposed to Anonymous ones, are TopicStates that
 * override the [TopicState::GetId](@ref DetectorGraph::TopicState::GetId)
 * method. This allows for code that deals with sequences of different
 * [TopicStates](@ref DetectorGraph::TopicState) in a general way. This is used
 * primarily outside (or at the boundary) of the DetectorGraph portion of the
 * application in applications that necessitate any need of generic/transparent
 * treatment of TopicStates. An example of this is
 * [GraphStateStore](@ref DetectorGraph::GraphStateStore) &
 * [StateSnapshot](@ref DetectorGraph::StateSnapshot). They are often also
 * called _Public_ TopicStates as they're what's exposed to the outside world
 * from the point of view of a DetectorGraph graph.
 *
 * TopicState "names" come from an application-specific enumeration value
 * for your named TopicStates - values must be cast-able to
 * [TopicStateIdType](@ref DetectorGraph::TopicStateIdType) and be different than
 * [TopicState::kAnonymousTopicState](@ref DetectorGraph::TopicState::kAnonymousTopicState)
 * (-1). An example would be:
 @snippetlineno trivialvendingmachine.cpp Application-Specific Enum for Named TopicStates
 (`C++03` enums are fine too)
 *
 * Which then can be used in the overriding of TopicState::GetId for the desired
 * named TopicState:
 @snippetlineno trivialvendingmachine.cpp Named TopicState
 *
 * That then enables things like:
 @snippetlineno trivialvendingmachine.cpp Inspecting Graph Output with Named TopicStates
 *
 * @section dga GraphAnalyzer
 * Finally, this example also shows how to use DetectorGraph::GraphAnalyzer to
 * generate a GraphViz-compatible `.dot` representation of the graph:
 @snippetlineno trivialvendingmachine.cpp Using GraphAnalyzer to Create dot file
 *
 * That .dot file when rendered generates the following graph:
 @dot "Trivial Vending Machine"
digraph GraphAnalyzer {
    rankdir = "LR";
    node[fontname=Helvetica];
    "BuyButtonClicked" [label="0:BuyButtonClicked",style=filled, shape=box, color=lightblue];
        "BuyButtonClicked" -> "SaleDetector";
    "CoinInserted" [label="1:CoinInserted",style=filled, shape=box, color=lightblue];
        "CoinInserted" -> "SaleDetector";
    "SaleDetector" [label="2:SaleDetector", color=blue];
        "SaleDetector" -> "SaleCompleted";
        "SaleDetector" -> "Balance";
    "Balance" [label="3:Balance",style=filled, shape=box, peripheries=2, color=limegreen];
    "SaleCompleted" [label="4:SaleCompleted",style=filled, shape=box, peripheries=2, color=limegreen];
}
 @enddot
 * Note that the _Named TopicStates_ are represented by outlined rectangles.
 *
 *
 * For a more sophisticated solution to a similar problem, see @ref fancyvendingmachine.cpp .
