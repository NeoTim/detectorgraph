/**
 * @brief A unit of logic in a DetectorGraph
 *
 * Detectors are compartmentalized algorithm with clear inputs & outputs.
 * It has fixed input types (Subscriptions) and fixed output types
 * (Publishing).
 *
 * A new detector is implemented by a new class that:
 * - Sub-classes Detector
 * - Sub-classes [SubscriberInterface<TopicStateX>](@ref SubscriberInterface)
 * for each TopicState it subscribes to.
 * - Sub-classes [Publisher<TopicStateY>](@ref Publisher) for each TopicState
 * it publishes.
 * - Calls to [Subscribe<TopicStateX>(this)](@ref Detector::Subscribe) in
 * the constructor for each TopicState it subscribes to.
 * - Calls to [SetupPublishing<TopicStateY>(this)](@ref Detector::SetupPublishing)
 * (or variants) in constructor for each TopicState it publishes to (see
 * Detector::Detector for more info).
 *
 * Detectors should be designed to be modular & finely grained. Note that
 * there's a trade-off between granularity & practicality/overhead and
 * sometimes it's easier to find the sweet spot by designing TopicStates
 * that provide intuitive intermediary state representations and then design
 * the detectors afterwards.
 *
 * For example, a trivial 'temperature threshold' detector could be:
 * @snippet helloworld.cpp Detector
 * For a complete example, go to [Hello World](@ref helloworld.cpp)
 *
 * More complex Detectors will subscribe & publish to multiple different
 * topics.
 *
 * Detectors can also implement BeginEvaluation() and CompleteEvaluation()
 * methods if performing a summary across multiple Evaluate() calls - with
 * calls to Publish() from within CompleteEvaluation().
 *
