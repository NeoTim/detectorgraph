 * @brief Base struct for topic data types

 * @code
struct AccelerometerData : public TopicState {
    int32_t x;
    int32_t y;
    int32_t z;
};
 * @endcode
 *
 * Ideally all TopicStates are self-explanatory and self-contained;
 * a subscriber shouldn't need anything else to act on it.
 * The rationale for calling it 'struct' instead of 'class':
 * - This is supposed to be a POD-like data container
 * - All methods here are only to support the data-carrying
 * functionality of TopicStates.
 * - This struct and its subclasses should not have any
 * private members.
